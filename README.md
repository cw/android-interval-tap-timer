# Android Interval Tap Timer

This Android app was developed as a simple way for me to track antibiotic self-administration over a timed interval after open heart surgery. As such, it was designed to address my needs and nothing more.

## Features
* Hard coded 30 second interval & 20 interval count
* Vibrates your Android device on interval end
* Flashes your Android device screen on interval end

## Future TODO
* Adjustable total interval count (currently set to 20)
* Adjustable interval duration (currently set to 30 seconds)
* Adjustable vibration intensity
* Enable / disable screen flashing on interval end
